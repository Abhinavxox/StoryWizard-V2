# StoryWizard-V2

### Introduction : 
StoryWizard is a narrative story generator web application based on GPT-3 Turbo. As we all know, kids love stories. Still, it can be a challenging task for parents and teachers to keep up with their constant demand for new ones. Our project offers a solution by providing a vast library of pre-made stories on various topics and the ability to generate new stories based on children's interests.

The app has an interactive and easy UI that children can easily navigate. Whether they want to browse through pre-made stories or generate a new one based on simple prompts like ‘Elephant and Ant’. To make it more engaging, I added a feature that allows children to ask follow-up questions about the stories, and the app will narrate the answers, creating an interactive experience.
It uses GPT-3 Turbo API to generate narrative stories and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech Conversion to convert the stories to speech so that it could have a play-pause button. Children can listen to the stories while looking at the accompanying visuals or images generated by Leap AI model. Along with that children can pause the narration and ask questions related to the story if they have any doubts.
